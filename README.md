## The assignment

Download this repo and edit the Javascript inside `index.html`.

* You'll find some existing D3 code inside the script tags. Put your code only in the `animatePage()` function.
* With D3 code, remove all spans in the page
* With D3 code, animate the heading so it transitions from black to hotpink color, in 4 seconds. After changing the color, animate the `margin-bottom` property so it goes to `100px`.
* With D3 code, animate the `margin-left` property of the paragraph to `100px`. Do not set up any duration (the default 250ms will be used).
* The endresult should look like this:
